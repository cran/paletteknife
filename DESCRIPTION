Description: Streamlines the steps for adding colour scales and associated legends 
         when working with base R graphics, especially for interactive use. Popular
         palettes are included and pretty legends produced when mapping a large 
         variety of vector classes to a colour scale. An additional helper for 
         adding axes and grid lines complements the base::plot() work flow.
